If you've made it this far, thank you very much for taking an interest in my article. To be honest, this paper represents my most innovative work to date. After uploading it to Researchgate, I noticed that there hasn't been much attention.

You'll notice many references to YOLO in the code, and you're correct. This code is a rewrite based on the open-source YOLO v1 or v2 by the great minds in the field. I didn't feel the need to rename the modified network to something like Futao_Net. Credit is due to the YOLO experts for their generous spirit of open-source collaboration.

The training data was generated using MATLAB, with each sensor individually saved as an npy file. As the training set is quite extensive, I've only uploaded a reference file for the labels. Yes, it's still in the simplified YOLO training format.

Lastly, a bit of a complaint about my work environmentâ€”yes, currently, I lack any experimental equipment (except for a computer and a desk), so the paper had to rely on numerical simulations.

I welcome further discussion. If you've reached this point, I appreciate it greatly. You can reach me at nifutao@tyut.edu.cn.
